# Module 1: Deck Construction
# 1. Scrape data from tournament reporting sites
# (2.) Categorize card categories
# 3. Deck list input
# (4.) Calculate deck statistics
# 5. NLP: Analyze differences between input deck and winning decks and give suggestions based off of list
#    -Any immediate suggestions (specific card is missing that exists in majority of winning decks)
#    -Recommend ratio changes (winning decks have certain ratios of card types)
#    -Ask for anything specific the user wants to analyze
# 
# 2. and 4. are technically not critical to the NLP portion, so will be set aside for now
